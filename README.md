# Nativeblocks compiler

The Nativeblocks compiler is a tool that generates server-driven blocks and actions based on Kotlin code. It produces
JSON and Kotlin files for each block and action, preparing them for upload to Nativeblocks servers.

## How it works

Before starting we need to add necessary dependencies

[Add KSP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#add-a-processor)

```groovy
implementation("io.nativeblocks:nativeblocks-android:[latest-version]")
implementation("io.nativeblocks:nativeblocks-compiler-android:[latest-version]")
ksp("io.nativeblocks:nativeblocks-compiler-android:[latest-version]")
```

Then it needed to provide ksp compiler arguments

```groovy
ksp {
    arg("basePackageName", "io.nativeblocks.sampleapp")
    arg("moduleName", "Demo")
}
```

### [How block it works on Action](/docs/action.md)

### Usage

After providing annotations for blocks and actions, the project generates Kotlin code and corresponding JSON files upon
building. These can then be initialize in MainActivity or via dependency injection

Note: The prefix for the provider name comes from the module name that provided
by [KSP argument](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#pass-options-to-processors). In this case, since we
provided "Demo," the
compiler generates with "Demo" prefix.

```kotlin
DemoBlockProvider.provideBlocks()
DemoActionProvider.provideActions(xBot)
```

For actions, all dependencies must be provided during initialization. To optimize performance, consider using dependency
injection for scoped or lazy instances.
